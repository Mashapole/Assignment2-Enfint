1. You need to write a program. This program finds the smallest key in the Map, prints the key/value pair to the console, and removes that data from the collection.

2. ArrayList. Write a method that receives a collection as input, the number of the element to be replaced, and a new value.
The program should replace the old element with the new one in the collection.

3. LinkedList. It receives two collections of unique numbers and the value of the element as input. It is necessary to insert the second collection into the first collection starting from this element.
Example.
First collection: 1,2,3,4,5
Second collection: 6,7,8,9
Element value (not its number!): 3
Result: 1,2,3,6,7,8,9,4,5
